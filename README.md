Beta release.

Very simple, ugly and inelegant package to sync Minecraft screenshots from a Windows machine to a (ideally) webserver 
accessible location which subsequently runs the PHP parse script to process the contents and display the images.

Frontend uses a getimagesize() which hasn't been fully reliable as yet.
